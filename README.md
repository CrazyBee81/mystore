  # MyStore Project Overview
  
MyStore is the final project of the Angular course of UDACITY`s Full Stack Developer program. I used no starter code, but the build relates to the content and exercises of the program.

## Project features
The application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website. This means a user can view a list of available products to purchase and add them to a shopping cart. After the user has registered he can complete the checkout process. Ultimately, a user that is signed in can check the five current purchases through the menu.

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **SignUp form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Checkout form**, which shows collected information about the user and asks form confirmation
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Getting Started

To get started clone the project and execute `npm i ` in your CLI to install all dependencies necessary to run the project. As this project consumes data from an external api from a previous course, the installation of "storefront backend" is needed as well.

* clone [storefront backend](https://github.com/CrazyBee81/storefront_backend.git). 
* `npm i ` in your CLI to install all dependencies
* follow the steps to set up a database from README
* run backend with command "npm run watch" on localhost:3000

After this, the project is ready to start. Type "ng serve" to run the single-page application on localhost:4200 in your browser.
